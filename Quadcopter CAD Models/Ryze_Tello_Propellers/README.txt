# Summary

USE AT YOUR OWN RISK.

I designed these to fit the Ryze Tello drone and they worked well for me. They do not have the complete functionality of the stock propellers, as the drone is not as stable and uses more battery than usual, but the drone still flies and flips.

Again, although I have had no issues using these propellers, please use at your own risk.

I printed the propellers with PLA and the caps with Ninjaflex. Print the propellers and caps in an upside down orientation, with support for the propellers.
